# Example interview debrief prompts
The following prompts are provided as useful starting points for facilitating post-interview conversations with your team. After each interview, invite your team to a shared document containing a set of discussion prompts. Give everyone one-to-two minutes per prompt to respond, then discuss.


## Warm up

- What stood out about this participant?
- What are this participantâ€™s goals? What matters to them?
- What are their challenges? What are some of their unmet needs and wishes?
- What stories did this participant tell?
- What about this interview reminds you of past interviews (if applicable)?

## Usability testing or concept testing

- What goal or task-oriented stories did this participant tell?
- What words did the participant use to describe their goals?
- What aspects of the participant's task performance went well?
- What aspects of the participant's task performance went poorly?

## Retro

- What went well about this interview?
- What went poorly (uncomfortable topics, awkward transitions, etc.)?
- How should we update our interview prompts (or, if applicable, wireframe or prototype) before the following interview?
