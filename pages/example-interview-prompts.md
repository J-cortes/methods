# Example interview prompts
This document provides example prompts grouped along the key moments found in an interview: introductions, warm-up, topic-specific questions, activities, etc. Edit these questions based on your research questions and/or any planned activities, such as usability testing. If your questions are specific or your participant’s time scarce, consider sharing a few of your prompts ahead of time. See [these](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/06/20/build-empathy-with-stakeholder-interviews-part-1-preparation/) [posts](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/07/22/building-empathy-with-stakeholder-interviews-part-2-conversation/) for an overview of planning and running interviews, [this checklist](/interview-checklist) for a detailed look at running an interview.


## Introduction

Hello, my name’s `[moderator]`. I'm a researcher at `[organization]`. As I mentioned over email, my office is currently working with `[partner]` to `[broad research goal; for example, inform a redesign of agency.gov]`. Joining us on the call are `[observers, and their affiliation]`.

I’d like to start by thanking for you making the time to speak with us. Your feedback is valuable and will be used to inform our team’s future decisions. Just to confirm, we’d like keep this interview to `[duration]` minutes. Does that still work for you?

Great. If you need a break or to stop the interview at any time, please let me know.

During this interview, I’ll ask you a few questions around `[topic]`. I’d like to note at the outset that I’m `[level of familiarity with the topic; for example: “I’m pretty new to this; I’ve only loosely read various background documents”]`. So I’ll start broad, and may ask you questions about what specific words mean. `[Later on, I’ll ask you directly about the topic of our research, and then I’d like you to share your screen and show us how you might use an prototype the team has been thinking about. You should have received an email from us with a link to the concept we’d like to discuss]`.

Please be aware that there are no wrong answers — you’re the expert here! We’re doing interviews like these to hear things from your perspective. Also, what you say will be confidential. Any quotes we share will be anonymized, and any artifacts we create will be  de-identify / anonymize to ensure that they cannot be attributed back to you.

Before we get started, I want to confirm that you received a [participant agreement](/participant-agreement) — is that correct? Have you had a chance to review it? Did you have any questions? If you haven’t already, please sign it and send it back at your earliest convenience.

Great. Two more questions: Do you have any questions for me at this time?

Finally, is it okay for us to record this conversation?


## Warm up

- To start, we’d love you to tell us a little about yourself — how did you come to be in your current role?
- What kind of person serves in your role, generally? Is this something that requires a specific kind of training or experience?
- What are your goals in doing your work? What motivates you?


## Topic-specific
- Thanks for that context. Now, I’d like to ask you a few questions about [topic]. If you had to explain this in the simplest terms possible, how would you do it?
- How does [topic] tie back to your goals in doing your work?
- What do you do when you have questions about [topic]?
- What’s one thing you wish were more straightforward about [topic]?


## Usability testing

- When was the last time you did [task]? Tell me more.
- Do you mind sharing your screen? [...] Before you share, make sure to close anything you don’t want recorded.
- Can you show me how you do [task]?
- Now I’d like you to take a look at the concepts I sent you over email before this call. Load the first one, and think out loud for me.

[Provide scenario and tasks]

## Wrap up

- Thank you so much for your time. Before we finish, is there anything you think we should have asked, but didn’t?
- Would you be open to speaking with us again in the future?
- Who else should we talk to?
